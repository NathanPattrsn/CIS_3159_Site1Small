    <p>We have over 150 Birds in our care at any one time.</p> 
        <p>We provide emergency medical treatment to give the birds the best chance of survival and regularly rehabilitate and release wild birds back to where they belong, in the wild!
        Captive bred birds are often lost by owners or sometimes deliberately released.  If we can trace the owners they are reunited.  If the owner cannot be found or no longer wants the bird we will try to house the bird with us or make suitable alternative arrangements.  The birds welfare is paramount.
